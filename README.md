# Java

A library system built using Java, using enhanced elements of the language (encapsulation,
information hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism), as well as complex data elements and
structures.

Elements from the software development lifecycle were used; requirements gathering, system
design (UML), system documentation, and testing using JUnit to write unit tests for every
function. The system strictly adhered to the object-oriented paradigm.
